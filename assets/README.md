This folder stores sound samples used by SynthLAN. Because binary
files are not included, each sample is available as a `[name].wav.txt`
file. Convert these text files back into `.wav` files before running
the program. Replace them with your own synth tones or loops if
desired.

high_traffic.wav   - Played at high network activity.
