This folder should contain four MP3 tracks used by SynthLAN. Add files
named `low.mp3`, `medium.mp3`, `high.mp3`, and `error.mp3`. These files
are not stored in the repository; place your own synthwave loops here
before running the program.

low.mp3    - Played during low network usage.
medium.mp3 - Played when network usage increases.
high.mp3   - Played at high network activity.
error.mp3  - Triggered on spikes or drops.
